What kinds of file lead to lots of compression? 
What kind of files had little or no compression? 
What happens when you try and compress a Huffman code file?

1. Files that have lots of repeating pixels or letters tend to perform the better with the program since
it is based on the frequencies of each characters within their respective files. The more a character appears in
its file, the shorter the code used to compress it is.
2. Files that have lots of distinct pixels or letters tend to perform worse with the program since
it is based on the frequencies of each characters within their respective files. The less a character appears in
its file, the longer the code used to compress it is.
3. The program reads the 1's and 0's of the double compressed file as characters and creates a new frequency table based 
on this, this ends up making the compressed file larger than the original compressed file.
